Some Lovelace setup

I showed my Lovelace config to Home Assistant group on the well known social network and many people ask me to share it. I guess this is the best way of sharing.
I like the play with the Lovelace config and I wanted to make my uniqe setup.
I hope my config helps to make your unique config too!
Many thanx for the people from the HA forum who give me the inspiration an ideas for this job!!!
