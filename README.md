Some Lovelace setup

I showed my Lovelace config to Home Assistant group on the well known social network and many people ask me to share it. I guess this is the best way of sharing.
Please note I use the storage mode therefore maybe need some modification in yaml mode.
I like the play with the Lovelace config and I wanted to make my uniqe setup.
I hope my config helps to make your unique config too!
Many thanx for the people from the Home Assistant Community (https://community.home-assistant.io/) who give me the more inspiration an ideas for this job!!!
